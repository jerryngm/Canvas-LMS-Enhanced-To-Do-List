# Enhanced Canvas LMS To-Do List (Chrome Extension)
This extension displays a comprehensive list of your ungraded submissions from all of your courses in Canvas LMS, featuring:

☰	Filter: Customise your view by excluding specific roles (e.g., TA role) or focusing on particular criteria (e.g., ungraded submissions older than 7 days).
🔽	Sort: Organise submissions in any order that suits your workflow, whether by submission date or other factors.
🔍	Search: Quickly find submissions based on various parameters, such as assessment names or student names.
💾  Export: Export the list to an Excel spreadsheet.
